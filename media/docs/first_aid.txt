Do not get all of the items below without doing thorough research yourself. You may not need all of these items.

A mountaineer will not want to carry large, heavy items, like instead of carrying rolls of gauze, or a bottle of burn relief gel, they'll carry an emergency bandage, and burn dressings in small ready-to-use packets. 

Sailors on the other hand may require a more substantial kit, you may need more than what is written here(depending if there are children or elderly people onboard), or how far you sail from shore. Again, do not blindly buy a pre-made kit, make a list of likely ailments and situations and get good quality medicine and first-aid kit items individually(source them from local pharmacies, not online).

Someone building a kit to care for protestors/bystanders in an adversarial environment, will want different items, and may want, for example, to stock up on multiple emergency bandages,  hemostatic dressings, and ingredients to counter the effects of tear gas or pepper spray. Someone else living in a city with an opioid problem may want to carry a CPR mask around, and a naxolone kit.

Make sure that you understand how to administer medicine, or to practice wound care, to a patient before attempting it. Take a first-aid course, read manuals, etc. When treating someone, be aware of allergies, or contraindicating medical factors and medicines(e.g,: Ibuprofen is contraindicated for anyone with heart issues, young or old).

I'll say it again. When assembling a first-aid or a medicine kit, consult rigorously peer-reviewed scientific research, make a list, and get individual items suited for your unique needs and situation.
