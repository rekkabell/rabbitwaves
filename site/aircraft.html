  <p class='noprint'>Ground to air signals. When one needs to communicate with an aircraft from the ground, it is easier to draw one symbol than to spell out an entire sentence.<br>The below symbols are understood by all aircraft pilots.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_02.jpg' alt='A list of symbols: I, X, II, F, a square, an up arrow, V, K, a triangle, LL, N, Y, a back L with L, and L' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>I : Doctor required (serious injury. X : Unable to proceed (need assistance). II : Medical supplies required. F : Food and water required. Box shape : Map and compass required. Up arrow : Proceeding in this direction. V : Assistance required. K : Indicate direction to proceed. Triangle : Safe to land here. LL : All is well. N : No. Y : Yes. Backward L and L: Don't understand. L : Need fuel and oil.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_03.jpg' alt='' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>The main symbols to remember are V, X, N, Y and up arrow.<br>Draw the symbols on the ground, form them using objects (branches, logs, leaves) or by trampling down into snow, soil, or sand, or by bending crops or tall grass.<br>Write or form the symbols in a way that they contrast with the natural background (ex: dark branches, or leaves, on white sand).<br>Make the symbols at least 4 m (13 ft) tall and 6 m (20 ft) long to ensure that they are visible from the air.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_04.jpg' alt='' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>Body signals.<br>When the aircraft is near enough and that the pilot can see you clearly, it then becomes possible to use your body to communicate.</p>

  <p class='noprint'>Can proceed shortly, if possible wait. Land here (point in desired direction). Need mechanical help or parts. All ok, do not wait. Pick us up; aircraft abandoned. Use drop message. Affirmative (yes). Negative (no). Do not try to land here. Our receiver is operating. Need medical assistance urgently.</p>

  <p class='noprint'>How an aircraft responds.<br>Message received and understood.<br>Aircraft will rock from side to side to indicate that the message on the ground was understood.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_07.jpg' alt='a float plane making a full right-hand circle with two rabbits aboard' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>Message received but not understood.<br>Aircraft will make a full right-hand circle to indicate that the message on the ground was not understood.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_08.jpg' alt='' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>At night, the aircraft will make green flashes with a signal lamp to communicate that the message was received and understood. It will produce red flashes if it isn't understood.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_09.jpg' alt='' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>Panel signals.<br>Whether on a boat, or on land, it is possible to signal to passing aircraft by folding a tarp, blanket, or some other fabric, in a specific way to form symbols.</p>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_aircraft_10.jpg' alt='A list of square blankets folded in a variety of ways. 1: blanket folded to form an arrow. 2: all 4 corners of a blanket folded to make a +. 3: top right and bottom left corner folded and touching in the middle. 4: the top right corner of a blanket folded to touch the middle. 5: The two top corners and the bottom right corners folded but not to the center. 6: Blanket folded in two diagonally. 7: blanket folded in 3s from the top, with 2/3rds visible. 8: Top and bottom edge of the blanket are folded, with a wide band visible in the center. 9: the two top corners are folded but not touching the center. 10: The top half of the blanket is folded so that the top right corner touches the bottom of the blanket. 11: The two bottom corners are folded but dont touch the center, with the top folded down to form a T. 12: The top band of a blanket folded but not touching the middle, with the lower right corner folded but not touching the middle. 13: The blanket folded in half diagonally but inside out.' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>Sea and land: ok to land (arrow shows landing direction). Sea and land: need medical attention. Sea and land : Do not attempt to land. Land : Need gas and oil or plane is flyable. Sea and land : Need first air supplies. Sea and land: Need food and water. Land : Should we wait for rescue plane? Notify rescuers of my position. Land : Indicate direction of nearest city, sea : Indicate direction of rescue craft. Land : Need warm clothing, Sea : Need exposure suit or clothing indicated. Sea and land : Plane is flyable or need tools. Land : Need quinine or atabrine, Sea : Need sun cover. Land : Abandoned plane on land, walking in this direction, Sea : Drifting. Sea : Need equipment as indicated (signals follow).</p>
