A vessel not under command, a vessel restricted in her ability to maneuver, a vessel constrained by her draft, a sailing vessel, a vessel engaged in fishing and a vessel engaged in towing or pushing another vessel shall, instead of the signals prescribed in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this Rule, sound at intervals of not more than 2 minutes three blasts in succession, namely one prolonged followed by two short blasts.

Maneuvering/Warning:
When vessels are in sight of one another, a power-driven vessel underway, when manoeuvring as authorized or required by these Rules, shall indicate that manoeuvre by the following signals on her whistle:

– one short blast to mean “I am altering my course to starboard”;
– two short blasts to mean “I am altering my course to port”;
– three short blasts to mean “I am operating astern propulsion”.

c) When in sight of one another in a narrow channel or fairway:
(i) a vessel intending to overtake another shall in compliance with Rule 9(e)(i) indicate her intention by the following signals on her whistle:

– two prolonged blasts followed by one short blast to mean “I intend to overtake you on your starboard side”;
– two prolonged blasts followed by two short blasts to mean “I intend to overtake you on your port side”.

(ii) the vessel about to be overtaken when acting in accordance with Rule 9(e)(i) shall indicate her agreement by the following signal on her whistle:

– one prolonged, one short, one prolonged and one short blast, in that order.

When vessels in sight of one another are approaching each other and from any cause either vessel fails to understand the intentions or actions of the other, or is in doubt whether sufficient action is being taken by the other to avoid collision, the vessel in doubt shall immediately indicate such doubt by giving at least five short and rapid blasts on the whistle. Such signal may be supplemented by a light signal of at least five short and rapid flashes.

A vessel nearing a bend or an area of a channel or fairway where other vessels may be obscured by an intervening obstruction shall sound one prolonged blast. Such signal shall be answered with a prolonged blast by any approaching vessel that may be within hearing around the bend or behind the intervening obstruction.

Emergency:

One prolonged blast: This signal is used to indicate the ship’s position in foggy conditions. It should be sounded every two minutes.
One short blast: This signal is used to indicate that a ship is altering its course to starboard (right). It should be sounded before the turn is made.
Two short blasts: This signal is used to indicate that a ship is altering its course to port (left). It should be sounded before the turn is made.
Three short blasts: This signal is used to indicate that a ship is operating in reverse.

Five short blasts: This signal is used to indicate danger or to signal that immediate action is required.
One prolonged blast followed by two short blasts: This signal is used to signal an emergency situation.
