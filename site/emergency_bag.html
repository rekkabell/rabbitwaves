What is essential varies per person, and so it is important to pack what you need yourself, considering each item carefully, instead of following a list.<br>Plan for a minimum of 3 days' worth of supplies.<br>How long you need to plan for depends on where you live, if there are evacuation centers nearby, or other dependable places where it is possible to re-supply. (On a boat, planning for longer is necessary).</p>

  <p class='noprint'>Some items ought to be shared by a group, carried in additional bags (ex: cooking stove, bucket toilet etc).<br>A good bag design:<br>1) Keeps your hands free. 2) Distributes the weight in the bag well (on the hips). 3) Is waterproof.<br>Pack the items away, and place the bag near an entrance so that it is possible to grab it quickly when leaving.<br>Store critical items on your person rather than in the bag (identity documents, money, prescription medicine, etc), in case the bag goes missing, or is stolen.</p>
