  <h2>Morse Signaling by Hand Flags or Arms</h2>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_handflags.jpg' alt='There are images of rabbits holding Oscar flags, and using them to signal morse code. For "dah" a rabbit holds two flags outward horizontally at arms length, for "dit" a rabbit holds two flags up over their head, to signal the separation of dits and dahs a rabbit crosses two flags downward in front of their body, to signal the separation of letters/groups/words the rabbit holds the two flag forward apart from each other, and the last signal consisting of a rabbit waving two flags about its head in circles is used to make a request for repetition(if by the receiving station) or to erase signals(if made by the transmitting station).' loading ='lazy'>
    <p class='noprint'>Allow for enough time between dots and dashes, and between letters, groups or words.</p>

The rabbit sees this.' loading ='lazy'>
    <p class="noprint">"Oh! I'm going to repeat the signals," the rabbit says.</p>
