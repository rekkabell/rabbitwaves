    <p class='noprint'>The International Morse Code is a way to communicate that consists of short and long sounds that penetrate interference with greater quality than spoken words.<br>The sounds are encoded are and expressed as: Dots, or Dits and Dashes, or Dahs.</p>

  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_intro2.jpg' alt='A merganser pronounces the accented letter é aloud, as well as its Morse equivalent, dit dit dah dit dit' loading ='lazy'>
    <p class='noprint'>There are... 1)26 basic latin letters (a-z) 2) One accented latin letter 3) Arabic numerals (0-9) 4) Some punctuation & prosigns.<br>Prosigns, or procedural signals, are shorthand signals used in radio. For example, "SOS", which is run as one word rather than as separate letters.</p>

<h2>Morse Code Encoding for Letters and Numbers</h2>
  <div id='wrap'>
     <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_letters.jpg' alt='A herring gull wearing an army cap says that most used letters were assigned shorter codes' loading ='lazy'>
       <a style='width: 39%;height: 9%;top: 41%;left: 60%;' title="Link to dichotomic search table image" href="../media/docs/Morse_code_tree3.png" target="_blank"><span>Dichotomic Search Table, CC BY-SA 3.0 by Aris00</span></a>
  </div>
   <p class='noprint'>Letter table: A = dit dah, B = Dah dit dit dit, C = Dah dit dah dit, D = Dah dit dit, E = Dit, F = Dit dit dah dit, G = Dah dah dit, H = Dit dit dit dit, I = Dit dit, J = Dit dah dah dah, K = Dah dit dah, L = Dit dah dit dit, M = Dah dah, N = Dah dit, O = Dah dah dah, P = Dit dah dah dit, Q = Dah dah dit dah, R = Dit dah dit, S = Dit dit dit, T = Dah, U = Dit dit dah, V = Dit dit dit dah, W = Dit dah dah, X = Dah dit dit dah, Y = Dah dit dah dah, & Z = Dah dah dit dit. Number table: 1 = Dit dah dah dah dah, 2 = Dit dit dah dah dah, 3 = Dit dit dit dah dah, 4 = Dit dit dit dit dah, 5 = Dit dit dit dit dit, 6 = Dah dit dit dit dit, 7 = Dah dah dit dit dit, 8 = Dah dah dah dit dit, 9 = Dah dah dah dah dit, and 0 = Dah dah dah dah dah.</p>

<h2>Cut Numbers</h2>
    <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_cutnumbers.jpg' loading ='lazy'>
      <p class='noprint'>Most numerals have a short form(not official), that temporarily borrows some of the encoding used for letters to communicate faster. The sender & receiver both have to understand that numbers are sent prior to transmitting.<br>A table of cut numbers begins: 1 = Dit dah(which is usually the code for A), 2 = Dit dit dah (code for U), 3 = Dit dit dit dah (code for V), 4 = (no short form), 5 = Dit (code for E), 6 = (no short form), 7 = Dah dit dit dit (code for B), 8 = Dah dit dit (code for D), 9 = Dah dit (code for N) and 0 = Dah (code for T).<br>A side note for the number 5 reads as follows: Some people send the uncit number for 5, because it is easy to mistake one dit for another signal.</p>

  </div>
      <p class='noprint'>When listening to combinations of Dits & Dahs, it is essential to learn to hear the particular character as a whole sound with a distinct rhythm.</p>

  <div id='wrap'>
   <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_learning.jpg' alt='An illustration consisting of a merganser youngling is listening to dits and dahs through a set of headphones, sweating, eyes wide, looking very attentive.' loading ='lazy'>

  </div>
      <p class='noprint'>Learn to recognize them by their sound patterns, not as separate elements. Think in code when reading, spare time practice will commit the melodies to the brain.</p>

<h2>Basic Rules for Morse Code</h2>
   <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_basicrules.jpg' alt='There is a graphic showing the actual timing of the words Rabbit Waves, as well as a drawing of many rabbits running close together, resembling a wave.' loading ='lazy'>
   <p class='noprint'>Rule 1: When sending Morse Code, these are no capital letters. Rule 2: The duration of a "dit" is the basic unit of time in Morse Code. Rule 3: A "dah" is 3 times the duration of a "dit". Rule 4: A period with no signal acts as a "Space" lasting 1 "dit" long. Rule 5: Each letter of a word is separated by a "Space" that is 3 "dits" long. Rule 6: Each word is separated by a "Space" lasting 7 "dits."</p>

<h2>Timing for Morse Code</h2>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_timing.jpg' loading ='lazy'>
   <p class='noprint'>Below is a visualization of the actual timing of Morse Code, again, with each symbol lasting 1 "dit." Following is a graphic showing the timing using "Rabbit Waves" as an example. The graphic follows the timing rules outlined in Rules 1-6 outlined above.</p>

<h2>Brevity Codes</h2>

<div id='wrap'>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_brevitycodes.jpg' loading ='lazy'>
    <a style='width: 9%;height: 14%;top: 0%;left: 61%;' alt="Brevity Codes" title="Brevity Codes , 7.1 MiB" aria-label='Open PDF' href="../media/docs/abbreviations.pdf"><span>Brevity Codes for Use at Sea (PDF)</span></a>
</div>
  <p class='noprint'>Brevity codes are designed to communicate complex information quickly, with greater accuracy, with a few words or code:<br>Rule 1: Q codes ranging from QOA to QQZ are reserved for use at sea. Rule 2: When using the letter C after certain abbreviations, the message takes on a negative sense. Rule 3: When using the letters N O after certain abbreviations, the message takes on a negative sense. Rule 4: Appending other groups, place names, numbers to abbreviations provides more detail.</p>

  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_brevitycodes_examples.jpg' alt='An illustration with a merganser and their child aboard a banana-hulled dugout, the adult has a vuvuzela in hand and is communicating the code QOD2? with it in Morse Code' loading ='lazy'>
  <p class='noprint'>Examples of abbreviations: QOD "Can you communicate with me in..." 0. Dutch, 1. English, 2. French, 3. German, 4. Greek, 5. Italian, 6. Japanese, 7. Norwegian, 8. Russian 9. Spanish.<br>QRD "Where are you bound for and where are you from?" QUA "Have you news of ... (name/call sign)?" QSQ "Have you a doctor on board?" QUX "Do you have any navigational warnings or gale warnings in force?"</p>

<h2>Morse Code in other languages</h2>
<div id='wrap'>
  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_nonlatin.jpg' alt='An illustration shows an anthropomorphised red-footed booby(Sula Sula), with a hat and a coat with a fluffy collar, saying 中文信息 (Zhōngwén xìnxī), meaning Information in Chinese, which renders into the code as 0022 2429 0207 1873' loading ='lazy'>
    <a style='width: 12%;height: 5%;top: 26%;left: 57%;' title="Chinese Telegraphy Wikipedia page" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_telegraph_code" target="_blank"><span>Chinese Telegraphy</span></a>
    <a style='width: 17%;height: 7%;top: 18%;left: 80%;' title="Documents for Morse Code in other languages" href="http://www.itu.int/rec/R-REC-M.1677-1-200910-I/" target="_blank"><span>Morse Code in Other Languages</span></a>
    <a style='width: 20%;height: 6%;top: 42%;left: 49%;' title="Chinese Commercial/Telegraphic Code Lookup" href="https://www.njstar.com/cms/chinese-commercial-telegraph-code-lookup" target="_blank"><span>Chinese Commercial/Telegraphic Code Lookup</span></a>
  </div>
    <p class='noprint'>Morse code was initially designed for latin characters, but have since been adapted to languages like Russian & Arabic. An example shows the Prosign WAIT in Russian, Arabic and in Morse Code(dit dah dit dit dit).<br>Languages with more characters, like Chinese, weren't as easy to transpose to Morse.<br>Instead of dots & dashes being assigned to characters directly, they assigned them to numbers instead. Characters were each assigned a 4-digit code ranging from 0000-9999, arranged & numbered in dictionary order according to their radicals & strokes.<br>An example shows the Morse numbers assigned to the Chinese characters used to spell out "wait"(等待). 等 was assigned 4583, and 待 was assigned 1769.<br>Because Chinese doesn't use non-digit characters, it is possible to simplify the morse code for digits(numbers can be quite long).</p>
