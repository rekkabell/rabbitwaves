    <p class='noprint'>The International Morse Code is a way to communicate that consists of short and long sounds that penetrate interference with greater quality than spoken words. The sounds are encoded are and expressed as: Dots, or Dits, and Dashes, or Dahs. There are... 1)26 basic latin letters (a-z) 2) One accented latin letter 3) Arabic numerals (0-9) 4) Some punctuation & prosigns. Prosigns, or procedrual signals, are shorthand signals, like SOS, which are fun as one word rather than as separate letters.</p>

     <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_letters.jpg' loading ='lazy' alt='a series of tables featuring all of the letters and numerals that were encoded into Morse Code'>
   <p class='noprint'>Letter table: A = dit dah, B = Dah dit dit dit, C = Dah dit dah dit, D = Dah dit dit, E = Dit, F = Dit dit dah dit, G = Dah dah dit, H = Dit dit dit dit, I = Dit dit, J = Dit dah dah dah, K = Dah dit dah, L = Dit dah dit dit, M = Dah dah, N = Dah dit, O = Dah dah dah, P = Dit dah dah dit, Q = Dah dah dit dah, R = Dit dah dit, S = Dit dit dit, T = Dah, U = Dit dit dah, V = Dit dit dit dah, W = Dit dah dah, X = Dah dit dit dah, Y = Dah dit dah dah, & Z = Dah dah dit dit. A gull interjects suddenly, saying, "Most used letters were assigned shorter codes!" Number table: 1 = Dit dah dah dah dah, 2 = Dit dit dah dah dah, 3 = Dit dit dit dah dah, 4 = Dit dit dit dit dah, 5 = Dit dit dit dit dit, 6 = Dah dit dit dit dit, 7 = Dah dah dit dit dit, 8 = Dah dah dah dit dit, 9 = Dah dah dah dah dit, and 0 = Dah dah dah dah dah. Now is a section about Cut Numbers: Most numerals have a short form(not official), that temporarily borrows some of the encoding used for letters to communicate faster. The sender & receiver both have to understand that numbers are sent prior to transmitting. A table of cut numbers begins: 1 = Dit dah(which is usually the code for A), 2 = Dit dit dah (code for U), 3 = Dit dit dit dah (code for V), 4 = (no short form), 5 = Dit (code for E), 6 = (no short form), 7 = Dah dit dit dit (code for B), 8 = Dah dit dit (code for D), 9 = Dah dit (code for N) and 0 = Dah (code for T). A side note for the number 5 reads as follows: Some people send the uncit number for 5, because it is easy to mistake one dit for another signal.</p>

  <img src='../media/content/2024_morse_handflags.jpg' loading ='lazy' alt='rabbits showing the positions to communicate morse with hand flags'>
    <p class='noprint'>Morse signaling by hand flags or arms : dash, dot, separation of dots and dashes, separation of letters/groups/words, request for repetition if by the receiving station or erase signals if made by the transmitting station. Allow for enough time between dots and dashes and between letters, groups, or words.</p>
